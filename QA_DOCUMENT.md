# Saleor E-commerce Platform QA Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides comprehensive information about the testing approach, methodology, and implementation for the Saleor E-commerce platform.

### 1.1 Project Overview

**Project Name:** Saleor Testing Project  
**Target Application:** Saleor E-commerce Platform  
**Version:** Latest stable (as of May 2025)  
**Date:** May 8, 2025

### 1.2 Purpose of Testing

The testing effort aims to:
- Validate core functionality of the Saleor platform
- Identify defects early in the development cycle
- Establish automated regression tests for critical user flows
- Ensure a high-quality user experience across all aspects of the e-commerce platform

### 1.3 Project Selection Rationale

Saleor was selected for this testing project because:
- It's a modern, production-ready e-commerce platform with both frontend and backend components
- It has complex user flows including catalog browsing, checkout, user authentication, and admin operations
- It uses GraphQL API which provides an opportunity to demonstrate API testing skills
- The application has sufficient complexity to showcase testing expertise while being manageable for setup
- It's built with Django and React, representing modern web technology stack
- It has well-documented setup procedures making it feasible to deploy locally

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Test Scope

This test project covers the core functionality of the Saleor e-commerce platform, focusing on:

- User authentication (signup, login)
- Product catalog browsing and search
- Shopping cart operations
- Checkout process

### 2.2 Out of Scope

The following areas are deliberately excluded from the current testing scope:

- Performance testing under high load
- Complete security penetration testing
- Mobile app testing (focusing on web interface only)
- Integration with external payment gateways beyond basic functionality

### 2.3 Testing Approach

#### 2.3.1 Testing Levels

- **Unit Testing:** Verify individual components function correctly in isolation
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure components work together as expected
- **System Testing:** Validate end-to-end workflows
- **Acceptance Testing:** Confirm the application meets business requirements

#### 2.3.2 Testing Types

- **Functional Testing:** Manual and automated verification of features
- **UI Testing:** Validation of user interface elements and interactions
- **API Testing:** GraphQL endpoint validation using Cypress and GraphQL queries
- **Cross-browser Testing:** Verification across major browsers
- **Regression Testing:** Ensuring new changes don't break existing functionality

#### 2.3.3 Manual vs. Automated Testing

| Testing Area | Approach | Rationale |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Critical User Flows | Automated | High-value paths that need frequent verification |
| Authentication | Automated | Security-critical and consistent behavior |
| Product Browsing | Automated | Core functionality with predictable outcomes |
| Checkout Process | Automated + Manual | Complex flow with varied payment methods |
| Admin Operations | Automated + Manual | Complex workflows with many edge cases |
| Data Visualization | Manual | Subjective assessment of dashboards and reports |
| Error Handling | Manual | Complex error scenarios difficult to automate |
| Edge Cases | Manual | Unpredictable scenarios requiring human judgment |

### 2.4 Test Environment

#### 2.4.1 Architecture

The test environment consists of:
- Saleor Backend (API) running on http://localhost:8000
- Saleor Storefront running on http://localhost:3000
- Saleor Dashboard running on http://localhost:9000
- GraphQL API endpoint at http://localhost:8000/graphql/

#### 2.4.2 Data Requirements

- Sample data populated through Saleor's built-in populatedb command
- Test user accounts with different roles and permissions
- Test products across multiple categories
- Test payment methods configured for testing

## 3. Test Automation Framework

### 3.1 Overview

The automation framework is built using Cypress with TypeScript, implementing the Page Object Model design pattern to provide a maintainable and scalable test suite.

### 3.2 Key Components

- **Page Objects:** Encapsulate page-specific selectors and actions
- **Test Fixtures:** Provide test data for consistent test execution
- **Custom Commands:** Extend Cypress functionality with reusable operations
- **GraphQL Operations:** Defined queries and mutations for API testing

### 3.3 Framework Structure

### 3.4 Key Design Patterns

- **Page Object Model:** Separates test logic from page interactions
- **Fluent Interface:** Enables chaining of actions for readable test code
- **Command Pattern:** Custom Cypress commands for reusable operations
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Using fixtures for consistent test data

## 4. Test Cases

### 4.1 User Authentication Flow

The authentication flow tests verify that users can:
- Log in with valid credentials
- See validation errors for invalid inputs
- Log out of their account
- Access admin functionality with appropriate credentials

Key test cases include:
- **TC001:** Login with superuser credentials
- **TC002:** Attempt to create user via API and login with those credentials (Expected to fail due to application restrictions)
- **TC003:** Successfully log out after login
- **TC004:** Verify admin login functionality

### 4.2 Product Browsing Flow

Product browsing tests verify that users can:
- Search for products
- Filter products by category
- View detailed product information
- Add products to cart

Key test cases include:
- **TC005:** Add a single product to cart
- **TC006:** Search for existing products and validate results
- **TC007:** Display complete product details
- **TC008:** Add product to cart from product details page with variant selection

### 4.3 Checkout Flow

Checkout flow tests verify that users can:
- Add products to cart
- Update product quantities
- Remove products from cart
- Complete the checkout process

Key test cases include:
- **TC009:** Update product quantity in cart
- **TC010:** Remove product from cart
- **TC011:** Progress through checkout with valid information
- **TC012:** Verify order confirmation after successful checkout

## 5. Identified Issues

During the testing process, several issues were identified and documented:

### 5.1 User Authentication Issues

#### Issue #1: Unable to login with user accounts created via API

**Severity:** High  
**Priority:** P1

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a new user account via API or admin dashboard
2. Verify the user exists in the admin dashboard (http://localhost:9000)
3. Navigate to storefront (http://localhost:3000)
4. Attempt to login with the newly created user's credentials

**Expected Behavior:** User should be able to login successfully  
**Actual Behavior:** Login fails despite valid credentials

**Possible Cause:** Authentication mechanism may not be properly synchronized between the admin backend and the storefront, or there could be a configuration issue with user activation.

#### Issue #2: No redirect after successful login

**Severity:** Medium  
**Priority:** P2

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Click login button

**Expected Behavior:** User should be redirected to the home page after successful login  
**Actual Behavior:** User remains on the login page after successful login

**Possible Cause:** Missing redirect logic in the authentication flow or incorrect route configuration.

### 5.2 User Registration Limitations

#### Issue #3: No user registration UI in storefront

**Severity:** High  
**Priority:** P1

**Description:** The storefront application does not provide a user interface for new customers to register accounts.

**Expected Behavior:** E-commerce platform should offer self-service registration  
**Actual Behavior:** No registration form or process is available to end users

**Possible Cause:** This could be a deliberate design decision for this deployment, or a missing feature in the current implementation.
